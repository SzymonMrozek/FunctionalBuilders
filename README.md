# FunctionalBuilders

A template for building views in **functional** way described in article.

## Idea 

Introducing **ViewBuilders** instead of using storyboards. Example **MVVM+VB** architecture:

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/architecture.png" alt="Architecture"/>
</p>

Generally the idea of **ViewBuilders** is to separate installing and setting up view to small functions and create one function that contatenates them all in flow. 

```swift
public static func buildView(withFrame frame: CGRect) -> HomeView {
   let homeView = HomeView(frame: frame)
   
   return Builder(view: homeView)
   	|> setupBackgroundColor
   	|> installLabelsStackView
   	|> installNameLabel
   	|> installAgeLabel
   	|> installCityLabel
   	|> endEditing
}
```

## Gain?

- Flow - we control step by step the process of building a view 
- Possibility to make view building generic 
- Clean structure 

## Constraints 

This framework also makes installing constraints easier, and more functional, like: 

```swift
ConstraintBuilder<UIStackView>(destination: stackView)
  .centerYConstraint(source: builder.view.centerYAnchor)
  .leadingConstraint(source: builder.view.safeAreaLeadingAnchor, constant: 15.0)
  .trailingConstraint(source: builder.view.safeAreaTrailingAnchor, constant: 15.0)
  .heightConstraint(constant: 200.0)
  .activate()
```

It looks more like flow-composed set of functions, we once set the destination view (the one that weâ€™re setting up) and pass only source for the constraints generating functions.


### Project Status

The project is under development now. It is not ready to use in production yet. We are drafting the idea now. Won't reccomend using it in production before we make our code well tested.

### Contribution

If you have any ideas how to make **FunctionalBuilders** better or found, fixed bugs please create a Pull Request.
